Capstone HW2 - Part 3

Hello, I'm a senior at Temple University pursuing a degree in Information Science and Technology. I enjoy traveling and have traveled to Asian on multiple occassions but have yet to travel to Europe. I like long walks on the beach and eating ice cream. I enjoy sitting in and eating loads of cookies and cream ice cream while staring into the deep dark space. Also, if you're friends with me, I'll buy you tacos one day. In my free time, I like to travel to the moon because I'm in an endless search for the best space burger.
